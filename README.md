Repository includes fulfilled tasks for chapters 7 - 17 of S.Kochan "Programming in C". 
(Tasks for chapters before 7 were too easy that's why they aren't presented here).

First task for each chapter is usually to type and run program listings from the chapter.
I fulfilled that but there is no need in these listings here. 
That's why tasks for each chapter usually start with number 2.
Names of files include points to number of the chapter, number of the task and hint to content of the task.
(program_Chapter_number__Task_number__Content).

Chapters are devoted to:
7 Working with Arrays
8 Working with Functions
9 Working with Structures
10 Character Strings
11 Pointers
12 Operations on Bits
